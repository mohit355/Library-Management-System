## Technology used

1. `React.Js` - For handling the view layer of this web application. Helps me to create different reusuable components to follow DRY. Reat.Js is most growing and very large developer community. Used different library of react like react-router-dom for routing etc.
2. `Redux` - Used Redux with React.Js for state management. This makes our task easier so that we need not to send props at multi-level in the HTML DOM (ract component).
3. `CSS` - Used Flexbox Layout for UI design and enhancement. I choose it beacuse , I need to show books card to the user and flexbox provides the functionality to manage the direction of the box, spacing between items etc. It's allow our element to align and distribute space within a container.
